                                    <p class="mb-5">Originally published on TeamKKStudio's blog <a href = "https://www.teamkkstudio.com/post/why-every-expectant-mother-should-photograph-her-baby-bump"> here </a></p>
                                    <p> While the mother carries her child for nine months in her womb, the excitement of the arrival of a little one is shared by her partner, family, and wellwishers. They say it takes two to tango and an entire village to raise a baby. So, why not do something fun to get everyone involved? A great way to not only capture that alluring belly of yours but also turn into a fun activity is…. </p>
                                      <p>Yes, you guessed it, a maternity shoot! </p>
                                      <p>Those nine months are described by many women as a rollercoaster ride. The transformation of woman’s body and its life-giving capability is beyond amazing. But there are also indeed moments where you won’t feel all that beautiful. Expectant mothers often experience mood swings caused by hormonal changes.</p>
                                      <p>Doing a maternity shoot towards the middle or end of your pregnancy is a great way to celebrate your achievements. It’s hard work to bear a child, and you deserve to feel special. You’ll get to dress up in elaborate outfits of your choice (and maybe even in your birthday suit) and pose away. </p>
                                      <p>It’s also a great way to involve the father of your child in the pregnancy process. Whether you want photos in an intimate setting or a playful outdoorsy vibe, you can communicate your vision to the photographer. Conceptual maternity, where artsy photos are taken to signify the arrival of a newborn, is another thing you can opt for. </p>
                                      <p> This creative expectant mother decided to allow her nieces and nephews to decorate her belly with non-harmful paint as a fun bonding activity. The end product was an absolute stunning glittery mess. It’s unsurprising that photos were just a bonus as they all had such a great time! </p>
                                      <p> With varied themes and cool props, you too can turn your fantasies to life. And last, but not least, you’ll have gorgeous baby bump photos to add to your collection of newborn photos and toddler photos. While you’re at it, why not use these images as a way to announce the pregnancy or even do a gender reveal? </p>
                                      <p>Oh, and did we mention our super attractive package? You can combine a maternity shoot, a baby shower shoot, and a newborn shoot. We have female photographers available upon request. </p>

                                    <p>It is every parent’s worst nightmare to have their child come running home with a head full of lice. While the sight of tiny insects crawling on your child’s head and your child tirelessly scratching their heads can be extremely distressful, remember that having lice is not a reflection of your child’s personal hygiene.</p>
                                    <p>Try to avoid panicking, showing disgust, or blaming your child for having lice as they could develop feelings of anxiety or inadequacy due to this. Ensure them that this is not their fault as, due to children often playing together in close proximity, lice spread like wildfire in schools and classrooms.</p>
                                    <p>Lice are simply microscopic parasites that attaches itself to human hair, feeds on human blood, and lays up to six eggs a day. Itching on the scalp is a common symptom as the body develops an allergic reaction to lice saliva. It is vital, however, to stress that lice do not carry infectious diseases. </p>
                                    <p>Once you have recognised lice for what it is, a nuisance and nothing more, it is time to eliminate them. The key is to start immediately and work rapidly before the lice multiply. But before you douse your child’s head with lice medication, you should know that these medications might not be the best option. </p>
                                    <p>1. Some lice medication like Permethrin only targets lice rather than lice eggs. Clinical trials also show that they are becoming less effective as lice evolve to become more resistant to the chemicals. </p>
                                    <p>There, therefore, can be no shortcuts when it comes to eliminating lice. You have to anyway supplement the process by manually picking out the lice and lice eggs. Tools like fine-tooth combs and techniques like wet-combing (combing the hair when it’s slippery so the lice and lice eggs fall out) are useful in the process.</p>
                                    <p>2. Toxic ingredients in lice medication can often be worse for your child than suffering from lice. </p>
                                    <p> Lindane, an insecticide toxic to brain cells, is one of many dangerous ingredients in lice medication. Side effects range from stinging and burning to trouble breathing and dizziness. In the long run, there can also be disturbances to your child’s nervous system. </p>
                                    <p>So, what can a concerned parent do? Luckily, there is a solution that completely avoids toxic chemicals. Here’s a tried and tested method for eliminating your child’s head lice the safe, natural, and effective way. </p>
                                    <p><b>Step 1: Oil</b></p>
                                    <p>1.Thoroughly oil your child’s hair using coconut oil.</p>
                                    <p>2.Manually remove lice and nits </p>
                                    <p>3.Leave for around 10-12 hours.</p>
                                    <p>Reason: </p>
                                    <p>Dryness of the hair increases friction, making it harder to remove lice and nits. Lubricating substances such as oil can help. This is particularly helpful on kids with naturally frizzy and curly hair. </p>
                                    <p>Side note: This is one of the reasons why mayonnaise is a popular alternative treatment. It does not kill lice or lice eggs but simply creates lubrication similar to oil. However, considering its pungent smell and thick consistency, using mayonnaise is troublesome. Oil is much easier to work with and wash off. </p>
                                    <p><b>Step 2: Wash and Rinse </b> </p>
                                    <p> 1.Wash and rinse your child’s hair using Conscious Living Shampoo </p>
                                    <p> 2.Apply generous amounts of Conscious Living Conditioner to your child’s hair </p>
                                    <p> 3.Comb your child’s hair using a fine-tooth comb. Remember to wipe the conditioner onto a tissue paper after each comb.</p>
                                    <p> Rinse the conditioner off </p>
                                    <p> Reason: </p>
                                    <p> Combing through with conditioner stuns the lice by making it difficult for them to grip onto the hair or spread nits. This is a common lice and nit removal technique known as ‘wet-combing’. Studies show that ordinary conditioner is just as effective as lice removal products.  </p>
                                    <p> <b> Step 3: Apple Cider Vinegar </b> </p>
                                    <p> 1.Dry your child’s hair using hot air from a hairdryer while combing through it </p>
                                    <p> 2. Apply Apple Cider Vinegar to your child’s hair </p>
                                    <p> 3. Leave for around 5-6 hours </p>
                                    <p> 4. Use a hairdryer to apply heat to your child’s hair (as this will allow the chemical reaction to speed up) </p>
                                    <p> Reason: </p>
                                    <p> According to anectdotal advice, apple cider vinegar has properties that can help dissolve the lice ‘glue’ making it harder for the lice to stick to individual hair strands. This will make it easier to wet comb out the lice in the next step. </p>
                                    <p> <b>Step 4: Wash and Rinse </b> </p>
                                    <p> (Repeat Step 2) </p>
                                    <p> <b>Step 5:Dry </b> </p>
                                    <p> 1. Dry your child’s hair </p>
                                    <p> 2. Check for head lice. If needed, manually pick out the remaining lice and nits.</p>
                                    <p> Reason: </p>
                                    <p> Aim to use acidic shampoos as they can be helpful in removing nits. Conscious Living Shampoo, through fermentation, is acidic without the use of chemicals. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">Originally published on TeamKKStudio's blog <a href = "https://www.teamkkstudio.com/post/8-steps-to-brand-your-wedding"> here </a></p>
                                    <p> The power of branding is more or less undisputed. But when it comes to weddings, we tend to associate it with the romantic union of two souls rather than a corporate brand building event. Perhaps that’s because we don’t quite understand what a brand is?

A brand is simply a story. It can, and indeed should, be incorporated into a wedding to tie everything together. When you have a story, your big day will feel more special and memorable. So, let’s go through the steps KKSTUDIO can take in helping you brand your wedding!</p>
<p><b>1.Logo</b> </p>
<p> A wedding logo is a symbol that reflects your personality as a couple. You can combine your initials or craft up something more creative! Far from being a modern invention, a logo is akin to age-old family coat of arms and will act as a nice seal to wedding stationery. </p>
<p> <b> 2. ‘Save the dates’</b> </p>
<p> Both a practical necessity and an aesthetically pleasing addition, ‘save the date’ e-invites should go on your list! By sending them out ASAP, you’ll allow guests plenty of time to plan their schedules. You can even send reminders! Go ahead and have fun with an elaborate photo shoot while you’re at it! </p>
<p> <b> 3. Websites, Social Media & e-invites </b> </p>
<p> For the super keen bean, you can design a website & social media pages documenting your journey as a couple to your wedding day! It’ll be like your scrapbook, with photos and little anecdotes, to share with your loved ones. This can also act as a template for an e-invite. What better way to make your guests feel involved and invested? </p>
                                   <p> <b> 4. Trousseau Packers </b></p>
<p> Have you heard the phrase ‘first impressions create a lasting impression’? Coordinate the design of your trousseau packers with the wedding theme, pick your favourite colours, and seal it with your logo. And voila, the feel of your wedding is instantly elevated! Use it for personal storage (Indian brides have a lot of bits & bobs to transport) or as little gift hampers for guests! </p>
                                    <p> <b> 5. Banners & Photobooth Props </b></p>
<p> When the big day finally arrives, you want all your hard work to pay off. Banners and photo booth props are one of the first things that your guests will notice. Do you want them to have a bit of fun taking selfies at your event? Or perhaps go ‘aw, that’s so them!’ when they first step into the venue? Bring your vision to life with carefully designed banners and photo booth props! </p>
                                    <p> <b> 6.Custom #hashtags & Live feed </b></p>
<p> Your guests (and perhaps those who couldn’t make it) will be spending a lot of time on social media so why not integrate your wedding into that as well? We can help you generate a custom hashtag and post a steady flow of stunning content. Another optional extra is to project this as a live feed during the event. It’s your wedding day after all, you’re allowed to go all out! </p>
                                    <p> <b> 7.Photobooks </b></p>
<p> While there are sure to be a plethora of photos and clips online, it’s sometimes nice to have something physical to hold onto. There’s nothing like cuddling up and flipping through the glossy pages of a beautifully designed photo book. We’ll help you select photos that capture your emotions and transports you back to the day. </p>
                                    <p> <b> 8. Wedding Newspaper </b> </p>
<p> Every major event is featured on the front page of a newspaper. For you, your wedding day is no doubt one of the most important days of your life. Although a ‘picture is worth a thousand words’, that doesn’t mean that words are not powerful. If you’d like to be a trendsetter, why not publish a wedding newspaper that will recap all of the key moments at your wedding? </p>

                                    <p class="mb-5">Originally published on the Debut Insight blog <a href = "https://debut.careers/insight/university-life-freshers-finalists/"> here.</a> </p>
                                    <p> Fresh faced and eyes wide with aspiration, it is not difficult to pick out a fresher in a crowd of students on campus. Going to university will transform you, they say. You’ll be away from the safe haven of your home and be one step closer to the realities of the ‘real world’.</p>
                                    <p> Whilst many people claim university to be the best three (or indeed four) years of their lives, exactly how much does it change us? We decided to speak to students at the University of Warwick to find out! </p>
                                    <p> <b><u>Do you miss living at home? </b></u> </p>
                                    <p> <b>General Fresher Verdict:</b> Although newly found independence was greatly appreciated, the general comforts of home were missed- support from the family and, of course, mum’s food.</p>
                                    <p> <b>General Finalist Verdict:</b> Spending time with family (as well as having home cooked food) was also missed.</p>
                                    <p> <b>Our verdict:</b> At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be much difference- both freshers’ and finalist (well, at least a sizeable majority) alike find cooking for themselves a pain. With freshers’, however, you can tell that they do not take their independence for granted and probably rely a lot more on the support system at home.</p>
                                    <p> <b><u>Do you feel closer to your friends at uni or your home friends?</b></u> </p>
                                    <p> <b>General Fresher Verdict:</b> Uni friends, due to easier access during term-time, are seen as much closer. According to most respondents, they feel that they can relate to their uni friends better because they are doing the same thing and following a similar path.</p>
                                    <p> <b>General Finalist Verdict:</b> It really depends on the shared experiences one has with either their home/uni friends over the course of their time at uni. On one hand, it’s easier to feel closer to home friends because you have grown up together and you tend to have similar backgrounds. On the other hand, however, it’s easier to make closer friends at uni because you meet such a wide selection of people to choose from and, as you’re often living together, they become more like family.</p>
                                    <p> <b>Our Verdict:</b> The responses aren’t surprising to us because, as a fresher, one tends to look at that particular moment in time. As a finalist, however, you realise that you won’t be around most of your uni friends either so you start to see the bigger picture- friendships are built around shared experience, and at each stage, your close friends know a part of you that your new friends probably never will.</p>
                                    <p> <b><u>Do you face any problems currently? If so, what are they?</b></u> </p>
                                    <p> <b> General Fresher Verdict:</b> Exams were seen to be quite stressful- the be all and end all of one’s life almost. Other than course related problems, budgeting was another area many students struggled with.</p>
                                    <p> <b> General Finalist Verdict:</b> For those that have not already secured a graduate job, the main problem is not knowing where to start when looking for a job or finding the application process intimidating.</p>
                                    <p> <b> Our Verdict:</b> This one is a no-brainer. We all know how exams felt like the end of the world when we were just starting out uni. And when speaking to any finalist student/graduate, the word ‘job’ is definitely going to come up somewhere in the conversation.</p>
                                    <p> <b><u>How do you envision your future to be?</b></u> </p>
                                    <p> <b>General Fresher Verdict:</b> Most people have an idea of what they want to do. But a lot of the time, they don’t know how to go about achieving that and are open to that changing.</p>
                                    <p> <b>General Finalist Verdict:</b> Most people found their own path after uni. Whether this may be a graduation scheme/job, time off to travel, or even moving back home to look for new opportunities.</p>
                                    <p> <b>Our Verdict:</b> There does not seem to be a set path after uni – people do what works for them because at the end of the day they are just starting out with their lives and don’t have to have it all figured out by their mid 20s. But, for a lot of freshers, they feel like they have to know where their lives are headed.</p>
                                    <p> It is generally agreed that one was more naïve and carefree as a fresher. Since coming to uni, one has the opportunity to become more open minded and confident thanks to living on their own. They also have a lot more life experiences and a lot more chance to make mistakes as well as to learn from those mistakes. </p>

                                    <p> “You alright?” </p>
                                    <p> Walking back to my halls of residence with groceries in hand, I wonder: Do I not look alright to you? Before I could respond, my coursemate who had asked me that had disappeared. </p>
                                    <p> I proceeded into the kitchen to cook dinner. Tonight’s menu: Thai-style Stir Fried Minced Pork with Basil Leaves and sautéed chili. Minor detail: the exhaust wasn’t working. As you can probably guess, this was a recipe for disaster. </p>
                                    <p> A group of people in the kitchen joked sarcastically, “Trying to choke us?”. Red-faced, I hurried back into my room. </p>
                                    <p> I bump into one of my flatmates in the corridors of Cryfield. She had a suitcase in hand and was surely enough heading back home for the weekend.
“Lucky you.” I commented.</p>
<p> Welcome to the life of an international student. </p>
<p> University, here in the UK, is an odd place to begin with.  It’s a rite of passage most 18 year olds take. It’s a transitionary step before venturing out into the real world. We’re leaving our nest for the first time, we’re thrown together with a bunch of people in the same boat as us, and we’re left to- in essence, ‘grow up’. </p>
<p> It is an exciting period- and most people do in fact claim their university years to be the best time of their lives, but I’m not going to lie, for us international students it can also be a daunting one. Not only do we have to deal with being away from home for the first time but also with a different environment and a different way of life.  </p>
<p> The first few months for me were, nevertheless, filled with excitement. I would appreciate the most random things around me: riding on double decker buses in Coventry, recognizing the roads in London from Monopoly, feeling like I was transported to the set of Harry Potter when I visited Edinburgh, and even seeing snow towards the end of January. Being here felt surreal- like an extended holiday. </p>
<p> Once the novelty began to fade, however, I longed for the familiarity and convenience of home. I craved authentic Tomyum noodle-soup from a street vendor at 2 am. I was sick of having to do the bagging at Tesco or having to take the buses. I missed the tropical sunshine and disliked bundling up in layers. And most importantly, I wanted people to understand where I was coming from- I was alone for the first time 5000 miles away from home.</p>
<p> I’m not trying to make studying abroad in the UK sound scary because it honestly isn’t. The UK, or the people here I should say, were extremely welcoming and due to the large pockets of diversity here it’s difficult to feel like an outsider. Even though there are fleeting moments of homesickness, we can’t let that prevent us from having an amazing time. Everyone has different ways of dealing with this but perhaps the following tips might help you if you’re anxious about how you would approach settling into student life in the UK. </p>
                                    <p> <b>1. Stay Occupied </b> </p>
<p> Courses in the UK- especially a social science or humanities one, require significant independent reading. Since I do Politics, I only have 9 hours a week! Yes, we’re technically supposed to be “reading”. But come on, no one actually spends the entire day doing so. This could potentially leave a lot of time for you to mope around. My advice is to stay occupied so you’ll have lesser time to dwell upon feeling homesick. Not that I’m discouraging people from reading for seminars- they’re useful, but there’s much more you could do that would enrich your time here.</p>
<p>  Societies, or student-run clubs, are a big part of student life in the UK. They range from ‘serious’ ones like Finance Society to more ‘fun’ ones like Cheese & Chocolate Society. A platform for like-minded people to mingle, societies are a fantastic way to make friends. Join a ton of societies (or just ‘like’ their Facebook Page) and go to their events- you never know who you might meet and what you might enjoy! If you’re passionate about any particular society, there are also options to apply to be on the executive team to organize the events. These positions are much like a full-time job and provide work experiences.</p>
                                    <p><b>2.Stay Anticipated </b> </p>
<p> It’s a universal fact that when you’re anticipating something exciting it distracts you from feeling down. Find something you love, plan things for the near future- things that you probably wouldn’t be able to do at home, and I guarantee you that you wouldn’t have time to miss home. I personally love travelling so when I’m feeling homesick, I simply countdown towards my next adventure! But I’m sure you can apply this concept to whatever suits your fancy! </p>
<p> If you’re into travelling as well, check out trips organised by the International Office in your university. Alternatively, go via a society- most course societies do both a domestic and international tour. Or, you could just travel with your new friends. There is so much to see and do within the UK- the top two on my bucket list are definitely Lake District and Snowdonia! </p>
                                    <p> <b> 3.Stay Balanced </b> </p>
<p> With the ease of staying in touch nowadays, one can get easily carried away- Whatsapp texts, Skype calls, and constantly keeping tabs on what’s happening with family and friends at home through Facebook.  It may prevent you from embracing your new surroundings. The key is finding a balance. Remember that what you see on social media may just be a sugarcoated depiction and people back at home most likely do have their fair share of worries and concerns as well. </p>
<p> With regards to balance, and this is especially relevant if you go to a campus university like Warwick, it can be overwhelming spending the whole term on campus. We have a name for this at Warwick as it’s in the middle of nowhere: ‘the Bubble’. Although I love it (despite joining Warwick Jailbreak, a hitchhiking challenge to get as far away from campus as possible!), I would recommend taking a break at least a couple of times each term. Consider Host International, a program that pairs you with a British family allowing you to visit them for a day or the weekend. It’s a great way to experience local cultures and meet ordinary people rather than just students!
</p>
<p> To end on a positive note, as an international student studying in the UK, I feel down at times but then I realize that by being here I get to immerse myself in different cultures, lifestyles, and modes of thinking. I’ve had a chance to travel, try new things, broaden my horizons, and grow as a person. I’ve not had the chance to go home every weekend and maybe that’s a good thing. Instead, I get to call this place my home away from home- at least for now.  </p>

                                    <p> 5,000 miles. 2 continents. A different world. </p>
                                    <p> As I wait to board my flight to the UK to embark on a new chapter of my life, I feel truly blessed to have the opportunity to travel to the other side of the planet. </p>
                                    <p> Whether it being exploring the cute little Shakespearean town of Stratford-Upon-Avon, hitchhiking to see the pristine Scottish highlands, the journey to Manchester to watch ‘The Script’ live, or frequent London trips for the big-city buzz; I’ve certainly not been disappointed.  </p>
                                    <p> But why stop there? If you just cross the channel into mainland Europe you’ll find a completely different but equally stunning landscape and architecture as well as rich culture and history.  The Europe trip I took last Easter, covering Paris, Vienna, Geneva, and Budapest, was such an eye-opener. Hooked onto travelling, I went all the way to Poland this year.  </p>
                                    <p> It’s surprisingly captivating to just wander about and get lost in a new city. You’re thrown into a different environment with your senses amplified, you interact with all kinds of people and learn to get by, and you gain a new pair of lens with which to view the world when you go back home. </p>
                                    <p> The media constantly bombards us with this image of a dangerous world but once you travel you realize that people are the same no matter where you go. It may be a cliché but you really learn so much more about life when travelling as opposed to just being cooped up in the library. </p>
                                    <p> And since I’ve already travelled halfway across the world to get here to the UK, why not make the most of it? Here’s why I think the coming to the UK for higher education is the perfect springboard for my travels! </p>
                                    <p> <b>1. There’s ample of opportunity to travel via societies! </b> </p>
                                    <p> Flooding my Facebook newsfeed is a ton of society tours- Cyrpus tour with Warwick Salsa, Prague tour with PPE society, ski trip in the French alps with Warwick Snow, etc.  The choice is endless! These society tours are great if you’re a newbie to travelling. What’s more, they’re really affordable as you benefit from group deals. Oh, if only I could go on all of them. </p>
                                    <p> If there’s nothing that suits your fancy, you could always start your own one! I’ve noticed, oddly enough, that there isn’t a Travel Society at Warwick so I just created one for the next academic year. Being at Warwick, with such dynamic student societies, has enabled me to take my love for travelling to a whole new level with this endeavor! </p>
                                    <p> <b>2. We get ridiculously long holidays! </b> </p>
                                    <p> I can only speak for the University of Warwick when I say this- we have ridiculously long holidays!  (But the time spent studying is nonetheless intense!)That’s a total of 5 weeks for Christmas, 5 weeks for Easter, and 3 months for Summer! You know what that means? Plenty of time to travel. Or plenty of flexibility when it comes to travelling because of budget restraints.</p>
                                    <p> <b>3. It’s super easy to travel! </b> </p>
                                    <p> As a Thai passport holder, I need to get a Schengen visa to travel to Schengen member countries. Because I currently reside in the UK, it’s easier for me to apply for one as I’m already in the EU. Not that it’s impossible to get one if I was living in Thailand, but it would probably require more money in my bank account as ‘proof of finance’. </p>
                                    <p> Besides, it’s much easier to explore Europe from here. There are loads of budget airlines you could take. Or, if you’re up for it, you could even take a bus. Last Easter, I took a Megabus from London to Paris- that was an experience in itself! </p>
                                    <p> <b>4. Everything will feel cheap for you! </b> </p>
                                    <p> If you live in the UK, honestly, you’ll find it a lot cheaper to travel the world than the vast majority of people as the pound is relatively strong. </p>
                                    <p> I was in Poland this Easter and everything, when converted into pounds, was so cheap! Except I realized that I probably shouldn’t be converting it into pounds but to baht- it wasn’t so cheap after all. </p>
                                    <p> Well, I guess if you have a part-time job [link to my Task 2 article on getting a part-time job] here in the UK and save up for your travels then this would apply! </p>
                                    <p> So, if you’re getting ready for starting studies in the UK. Get ready for the biggest adventure of your life! </p>

                                    <p> Originally published on TeamKKStudio's blog <a href = "https://www.teamkkstudio.com/post/5-things-people-say-that-annoy-photographers"> here </a> </p>
                                    <p> The nature of photography has changed massively in the last couple of decades. Cameras are increasing in quality, prices are coming down, and there are plenty of user-friendly editing applications out there. With an iPhone X and an on-point Instagram feed, anyone can claim to take pretty pictures.</p>
                                    <p> It’s no doubt a positive development. But it can also lead to ignorance about the role of professional photographers who have dedicated their whole lives to capturing and producing stunning images. If they’re shooting parties, they seem to be doing what everyone else is doing: having a laugh and clicking away. </p>
                                    <p> While it may look all glamorous on the outside, the reality couldn’t be any more different. It stems from the fact that most people don’t understand the life of a photographer. We hope to debunk certain myths and provide you with the top five comments that photographers are tired of hearing. </p>
                                    <p> <b>1. Your camera takes good photos.</b> </p>
                                    <p> While most photographer will reply with a polite ‘thank you’, they’d want you to know that it takes a lot of time and dedication to update their skills to use all of these cool features available. As trends and technologies are constantly changing, hours are spent on Youtube and Google figuring out which new cameras & lenses to buy, how to use drones, and general tips to improve photography skills. </p>
                                    <p> <b>2. You’re coming to our event, right? Just bring your camera along.</b> </p>
                                    <p> Your photographer friend may as well be snapping from their smartphone at your event. However, it’s a bit unfair to expect the same level of quality and service that goes into a professional shoot. It’s akin to telling your chef friend to bring some food along to your house party. Or your accountant friend to do the budgeting for your birthday bash. Furthermore, the bulk of the work with photography is the editing/post-production process. </p>
                                    <p> <b>3. Can you send us the photos immediately? I would like to post them on social media.</b> </p>
                                    <p> It may be tempting to change your profile picture immediately after the event. For a photographer, however, it’s not as simple as that. The majority of the time is spent uploading high-resolution photos, going through them and selecting nice ones, editing the images and adding filters, as well as backing them up. Despite this, KKSTUDIO has a 24-hour turn around where you’ll be provided with ‘sneak peaks’ of your photos. </p>
                                    <p> <b>4. Why is there a watermark on the photos? I don’t want it there.</b></p>
                                    <p> High-resolution non-watermarked images are provided to all clients on a flash drive. For pictures that we upload online, however, we prefer to have our watermark there as it is an extension of our brand. As a lot of creativity and hard work goes into producing these images, we humbly request that credit is given where credit is due. The watermark also ensures that the photos can be freely shared. </p>
                                    <p> <b>5. You have a really easy and fun job!</b> </p>
                                    <p> Here at KKSTUDIO, we are a team of passionate photographers who love our work. But that doesn’t mean that it’s an easy job. No matter how experienced or professional the photographer is, technical problems are bound to occur as everything is digitalised. We always have a plan of action in case things go wrong. It’s important to be able to manage stress, have problem-solving skills, and work in a team to minimise risks. We also backup all the photos up until one year after the event. </p>

                                    <p> Originally published on TeamKKStudio's blog <a href = "https://www.teamkkstudio.com/post/choosing-a-wedding-photographer-look-beyond-the-camera-lens"> here </a> </p>
                                    <p> If your wedding day was a film and you could hit pause for the perfect photo, where you’d pause would reflect you as a person. Will it be the moment an army of aunties are draping your saree on, the moment you’re twirling around the dance floor like a princess, or the moment you’re  sharing a laugh with your groom-to-be? </p>
                                    <p> Photography isn’t only about pretty pictures. If that was the case, then all you’d need is a standard formula (good camera lenses, the right angle, and sufficient lighting) to churn out stunning images. But photography is also about perspectives. It’s about evoking a particular emotional response from those raw and intimate moments.</p>
                                    <p> We sat down with Kirty Khanijou, creative director here at KKSTUDIO, to see how she feels emotion comes into play in wedding photography and what you should consider when choosing a wedding photographer.</p>
                                    <p> <b><u>What role does emotion play in wedding photography? </u></b></p>
                                    <p> “Weddings are undeniably one of the most significant milestones in a couple’s life. Across many cultures, and especially in Indian culture, a lot importance is given to this rite of passage. Whether you’re having ‘big fat wedding’ or a ‘small intimate affair’, you’re going to want to look back and cherish these moments forever. </p>
                                    <p> Good photos should not just be visually pleasing but should have the capability to transport you back to your wedding day. And that’s where emotions come into play- it makes the difference between still images and memories. With Indian weddings being so colourful and chaotic, not capturing the emotions would truly be a shame.” </p>
                                    <p> Do you think your background helps you in capturing the emotions in a wedding? </p>
                                    <p> <i>“Every photographer has a unique perspective, in part influenced by their background and interests, which would give them an advantage in certain scenarios. I’d never make a good war or conflict photographer, for instance! It’s all about tapping into your areas of strength and adding your own flair to the photos.</i> </p>
                                    <p> <i> I personally feel comfortable capturing the emotions of joy in a wedding or in those big moments in a couple’s life like when they welcome their bundle of joy. I’m humbled to be let in into their lives and to be a part of their celebrations. And yes, being a Thai-Indian female definitely helps when shooting Indian weddings and Indian destination weddings in Thailand.”</i>  </p>
                                    <p> <b><u>Any specific examples?</b></u> </p>
                                    <p> <i> “You know wedding photography isn’t just about taking photos but there’s a lot of coordinating involved. I once had to ask hotel staff to readjust the ‘mandap’ as per the requirements of my clients. Being a Thai-Indian, I understand Indian culture and wedding rituals. At the same time, I am able to communicate in Thai with hotel staff or vendors.</i></p>
                                    <p> <i> I also feel that being a female is an advantage as I am often in and out of the bride’s dressing room. It makes the bride and the women much more comfortable when we’re filming them getting ready. I once even assisted the bride out with her ‘chunni’ as her makeup artist was Hong-Kong Chinese and wasn’t able to do so.” </i></p>
                                    <p> <b><u>If you had to give one piece of advice to couples choosing a wedding photographer, what would it be? </b></u></p>
                                    <p> <i> “If I had to give couples one advice when choosing a wedding photographer, it is this: look beyond the camera lens. And by that I mean, yes make sure your photographer and/or team has technical skills and are able to deliver stunning photos. But beyond that, make sure you’re comfortable with the photographer and they understand your needs.</i></p>
                                    <p> <i> For instance, I always personally meet the bride & groom before the wedding. Even if they’re from abroad and have appointed someone on their behalf, I make time to have a chat with them. It’s important to establish a level of familiarity, understand their personality, and create a custom plan of action.” </i></p>
